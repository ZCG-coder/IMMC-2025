    <span>Problem Introduction</span>
</h1>

<div class="emu-body-container">
    <h2><span class='header'>1 &dash; Introduction</span></h2>
<p>
We chose problem E as our focusing problem this time. The task is about creating an optimization model that can
maximize the green energy used, and minimize:</p>
</p><ul>
<li>the cost of purchasing power, both green power and traditional power,</li>
<li>the delay for each task</li>
<li>the excess / short of green energy for each hour</li>
</ul>
<p>

The amount of green energy available, prices of energy supply, and task demand for each hour are given. Therefore, the
goal is to create a model (function) that represents the number of tasks for each hour. The task management system can
thus use this model to decide the amount of tasks that are suitable for processing in the current hour, and decide
whether to delay outstanding tasks, in order to save cost, energy and promote green energy.</p>
<p>
Our solution should be based on the following principles:</p>
</p><ol><li>Tasks should be <b>delayed as little as possible</b>, as delays for a server in the modern world is expensive <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-9f5af10cdbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 1]</a>.</li>
<li>Even if there is a delay, higher-urgency tasks should be delayed the least.</li>
<li><b>Green energy should be applied as much as possible</b>, reducing surpluses and shortages.</li>
<li>The <b>cost of the power supply should be as low as possible</b>, reducing cost for tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<h2><span class='header'>2 &dash; Strategy</span></h2>
<h3><span class='header'>2-1 &dash; Identify</span></h3>

We noticed that,</p>
</p><ul>
<li>As the power drawn out is linear, the energy should be described by #E = Pt#. As the power is given hourly, the working units should be in kWh. The power given in MW can be transformed to kWh by multiplying by 1000.</li>
<li>Delaying high-urgency tasks costs more, so lower-urgency ones need to be considered first while calculating delay.</li>
<li>Delaying can never occur after 23:00, as the question is about creating a 24-hour plan. Therefore, all tasks must be done in the 24-hour span.</li>
<li>As green energy is prioritized, tasks should be balanced to use most of the green energy available in the hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><span class='header'>2-2 &dash; Set-up</span></h3>

Based on our observation, we agreed that creating a simulation program that repetitively simulates planning of a day can
best solve this problem.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Electricity Price Coordination</span></h4>

The electricity price and availability for each hour is different. Our solution calculates the energy needed for an
hour. Then, by #E = Pt#, we can obtain the total amount of electricity available for each hour. We can then compute the
electricity costs for each hour.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Delay and Cost Optimization</span></h4>

Since tasks needs to be delayed as little as possible, we try to discourage delays by adding awards and punishments. If
there is a delay to a task, its corresponding score will be reduced. Our score reduction system is defined as follows</p>
<p>
##
P =
\begin{cases}
    100\% \cdot 0.6 \cdot e^d,& \text{if } u = \text{HIGH}\\
    100\% \cdot 0.7 \cdot e^d,& \text{if } u = \text{MED}\\
    100\% \cdot 0.8 \cdot e^d,& \text{if } u = \text{LOW}\\
\end{cases}
\text{, where }
\begin{cases}
d &= \text{The delay in hours}\\
u &= \text{The urgency}\\
\end{cases}
##</p>
<p>
The cost to run the tasks should be optimized as well. Therefore, for each iteration, if
# \Sigma_{i=1}^n {T_{mark,i}} \gt ( \Sigma{T_{mark}} ) _{max}, \text{where } T_{mark} \text{ is the mark of a task} #,
and # \Sigma_{i=1}^n {E_i} \lt ( \Sigma{E_i} ) _{min}, \text{where } E \text{ is the price of the energy consumed in an
 hour} #, the iteration is considered to be better than the last one. # ( \Sigma{T_{mark}} ) _{max} # and
# ( \Sigma{E} ) _{max} # should be replaced with # \Sigma_{i=1}^n {T_{mark,i}} # and # \Sigma_{i=1}^n {E_i} #
respectively.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Green Energy Optimization</span></h4>

As green energy should be used primarily, if there is not enough green energy to run all the tasks, lower-urgency tasks
can be delayed.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Randomization</span></h4>

To create variance, random numbers are used. The tasks are generally delayed at a #1/4# chance. When green power is not
enough, they are delayed at a #1/2# chance.</p>
<h3><span class='header'>2-3 &dash; Expected outcome</span></h3>
<p>
We hope to obtain three arrays of integers, each describing the number of high-urgency, medium-urgency and low-urgency
tasks. Then, by curve fitting, we would obtain three functions, # N_{high}(t) #, # N_{medium}(t) #, and # N_{low}(t) #.
The three functions would allow interpolation in the dataset.</p>

    <span>Methods</span>
</h1>

<div class="emu-body-container">
    <h2><span class='header'>1 &dash; Implementation</span></h2>
<p>
Python <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-9f70ecbedbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 1]</a>
on Jupyter Notebook <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-9f93552edbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 2]</a> are used to implement the solution. See Appendix A for more information on
the code.</p>
<p>
We mainly used the following libraries:</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Numpy <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-9fac3e0edbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 3]</a></span></h4>

Provides convenient data storage and operation functions, allowing us to calculate exponents, standard deviations, etc,
without writing extra code. Additionally, the &nbsp;<code>polyfit()</code> function provides polynomial curve fitting functions, which
are crutial to our goal.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Matplotlib <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-9fe30ef2dbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 4]</a></span></h4>

Provides graphing functions, allowing us to generate graphs for output. We can then use the graphs for inspection and
presentation.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>SymPy <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-a00365dadbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 5]</a></span></h4>

Provides symbolic math functions, for us to convert Numpy-generated polynomial coefficients into polynomials with
unknowns, and display them as well.</p>
<h2><span class='header'>2 &dash; Method</span></h2>
<p>
This code defines two classes: &nbsp;<code>Priority</code> (an enum for task priority with associated energy consumption) and
&nbsp;<code>Task</code> (containing start time, priority, workload, and delay, with a method &nbsp;<code>calc_mark</code> calculating a task's mark
based on priority and delay using an exponential function). This code defines two classes: &nbsp;<code>Priority</code> (an enum for
task priority with associated energy consumption) and &nbsp;<code>Task</code> (containing start time, priority, workload, and delay,
with a method &nbsp;<code>calc_mark</code> calculating a task's mark based on priority and delay using an exponential function). A list
&nbsp;<code>ORIG_TASKS</code> is created, populating it with multiple &nbsp;<code>Task</code> instances with varying parameters. An optimization process
iteratively delays tasks based on probabilities (1/4 initially, 1/2 if renewable energy is insufficient), and awards
points randomly for delays, calculates energy costs, and updates the total marks.</p>
<p>
For each hour delay, we will deduct 20,30 and 40 percent of the score each hour a low, medium, high urgency task is
delayed respectively</p>
<p>
The algorithm aims to maximize total marks while minimizing energy costs, iterating 10,000 times to find an optimal
solution. Finally, statistical analysis is performed on the results, summing task values, and fitting curves
(9th-power polynomials) to the number of tasks per hour for each priority level.</p>
<h2><span class='header'>3 &dash; Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>
The results will be evaluated with the following</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Residue</span></h4>

The residue <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-a061477cdbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 6]</a> is differences between the response data
and the fit to the response data at each predictor value.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>RSS</span></h4>

The residual sum of squares <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-a58ca066dbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 7]</a> is a way to evaluate
curve fitting, and measures the level of variance in the error term, or residuals, of a regression model. Lower values
mean that the covergence is higher.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Error Variance</span></h4>

Error variance <a class="emu-ref" href="#emu-ref-a628a740dbcc11efafc60a031818b10c">[REF 8]</a> is the variance of errors between the fitted line
and the known data points. Smaller error variance means that the fitted curve maintains a smaller distance from known
data points.</p>

    <h2><span class='header'>1 &dash; Introduction</span></h2>
<p>
Mathematical modeling is indeed a powerful tool for solving complex problems, which unfortunately comes
with several inherent limitations that can affect its applicability and accuracy in real-world scenarios.
The limitations of the mathematical modeling approach described in the Appendix A are inherent in both the methodology
and the practical implementation of the task optimization process. These limitations highlight the challenges of
balancing theoretical models with real-world constraints and achieving optimal solutions. Below is a detailed
discussion of the most significant limitations:</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Solution may not be optimized</span></h4>

Our model often relies on loops to iterate through tasks and evaluate solutions. While this approach is computationally
effective, it is not possible to fully explore all combinations of task delays and assignments, so it is not easy to
find fully optimized solutions. This limitation is especially problematic for complex systems when the solution space
is vast, and a more exhaustive search might be required to find more accurate results. As we unfortunately do not have
enough time for long searches, it is not easy to find the optimal solution.</p>
<p>
The use of randomization in delaying tasks and awarding marks also results in a stochastic process that prioritizes
certain solutions over others purely by chance. While the program iterates through 10,000 simulations, even this number
of iterations may not be sufficient to find the true global optimum in a highly complex solution space. Moreover, the
model's reliance on heuristics, such as delaying tasks only until 23:00, imposes additional constraints that limit the
scope of potential solutions.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Errors in the best-fit curve</span></h4>

When we analyse the data, the program applies curve fitting to model the distribution of
tasks across different priority levels (High, Medium, Low) over time. However, the best-fit curves are power
polynomials, which, while useful for approximating trends, rarely represent real-world data perfectly. Although the
residue sum of squares (RSS) is already minimised, deviations between the actual data points and the fitted curve
can still introduce inaccuracies, leading to misinterpretation of task distributions or energy usage patterns. These
mini errors made the model a little less reliable.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Not possible to fully balance usage of green energy and production costs</span></h4>

One of the objectives of our model is to balance conflicting goals, such as minimizing energy costs and
maximizing task marks. However, this balance is difficult to achieve in practice because the weights assigned to
different priorities (e.g. energy consumption, delays, and task marks) are subjective and may not reflect real-world
trade-offs accurately. For example, prioritizing renewable energy usage might result in higher delays, while minimizing
delays might lead to increased reliance on traditional energy sources, which are costlier and less sustainable. We must
admit that the model is unable to achieve a perfect equilibrium.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Time constraints and delays.</span></h4>

The program enforces a strict rule that no task can be delayed beyond 23:59, as the question specifies a 24-hour plan.
While this constraint simplifies the modeling process, it introduces a significant limitation in reflecting real-world
scenarios. In many real-life applications, tasks can be deferred to subsequent days or periods to optimize resource
utilization and cost. By restricting delays to a single day, the model sacrifices realism and flexibility, which might
undermine its applicability to scenarios where tasks span multiple days.</p>
<p><h4><span class='header'>Assumptions being made about energy supply and costs.</span></h4>

The energy supply data (both renewable and traditional) and their respective costs are predefined and static in the
model. While this simplifies calculations, it does not account for dynamic changes in energy availability or price
fluctuations that occur in real-world markets. For instance, the renewable energy availability might vary due to weather
conditions, or traditional energy prices could shift based on demand. The static nature of these inputs limits the
model’s ability to adapt to realistic energy supply scenarios.</p>
<p>
Also, a power supply system has energy dissipated into the surrounding environment, so the estimated energy usage is
less than the actual amount. Assuming linear power usage also cannot reflect the real-world scenarios, as computers use
varying amount of energy when processing a task.</p>
<h2><span class='header'>2 &dash; Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>
In conclusion, while our approach provides a structured framework for solving the problem, it is constrained by several
limitations. The reliance on looping mechanisms and randomization, errors introduced through curve fitting, and the
inability to achieve truly optimal solutions all contribute to the model's shortcomings. Additionally, the rigid time
constraints, difficulty in balancing competing objectives, and static assumptions about energy supply further reduce
its applicability to real-world scenarios. Addressing these limitations through more sophisticated algorithms, dynamic
inputs, and better optimization strategies would enhance the model’s accuracy and usability.</p>
